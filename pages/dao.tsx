                  is a collective of artists, musicians and digital media
                  creators on a mission to create a more decentralized and
                  equitable record label called &apos;The Hidden Hare&apos; that
                  offers buyers of their NFTs exclusive access to private
                  parties, concerts and festivals at their community arts center
                  in Athens, GA. They&apos;re building a token-gated digital art
                  gallery that features VR-live streaming of their weekly public
                  events like song circles, open mic nights and the monthly open
                  jams. &quot;We are thrilled to be working with Sapien Network
                  to build out our smart contract DAO with a built-in NFT
                  marketplace and a collective governance model that returns the
                  power, often usurped by executives and middlemen, back to the
                  artists who deserve it most.&quot; - Nick Bradfield, Rabbit

                  JournoDAO is on a mission to buy a newspaper alongside the
                  communities it serves and use Web3 tools to improve it to
                  serve those communities better. To prepare for this mission,
                  we are building an incubator for projects that transform and
                  rethink the journalism ecosystem using tools such as
                  decentralized newsrooms, on-chain reporting, tokenized
                  ownership, and peer-to-peer distribution.
