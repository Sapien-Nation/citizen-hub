                passport NFT collection
              </a>
              . While most NFT projects drop randomly generated, fairly
              homogenous collections, Sapien aspired to make each avatar highly
              individualized and meaningful. Unlike other projects, each person
              gets to be involved in the avatar creation process through
              selecting their historical figure as well as their avatar‚Äôs
              picture.
            </p>
            <p>
              We made the first avatars in a WeWork with my friend Kalani, using
              old Python notebooks from when he first started getting into deep
              learning. There were two requirements - the collection needed to
              feature stylized figures from history and that they should look
              trippy. The collection was aptly named ‚ÄúA Trip Through Time.‚Äù The
              pipeline overall was fairly simple and relied on two pre-trained
              models, one for semantic segmentation and another one for style
              transfer.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, the semantic segmentation model produces classifications
              for each pixel in an image (in this case determining if a pixel
              belongs to a person or the background). We use this to
              automatically remove the background from any images.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, the style transfer model was used to apply the styling for
              the images. The task of neural style transfer is to take the
              ‚Äústyle‚Äù of one image and apply it over to another by optimizing
              the statistics between two images. This allows you to replicate
              the styling of say Picasso onto your favorite picture. In our
              case, we used the Sapien logo to stylize the images of each
              historical figure. Our initial avatars looked like this.

            <p>
              While the style and look certainly wasn‚Äôt the worst, the avatars
              still didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúspecial.‚Äù The colors weren‚Äôt bright, the images
              showed lots of negative space, and many avatars lost detail in
              their features. In order to resolve these issues, I went back to
              the drawing board.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first pulled all Sapien assets from the company drive to see the
              stylization results for different variations of the logo. In
              addition, after some suggestions from our CMO, Hash, I
              pre-processed the avatars after the background removal to sharpen
              the details in some of the images. This led to some interesting
              results.

              I personally liked the style on the right, but the team agreed
              that the middle result was best given it balanced the vibrancy of
              the colors with the preservation of the facial features.

            <p>
              While we were all satisfied with the stylization in the middle,
              Hash found that the avatars didn‚Äôt pop quite as much when they
              were shrunk to thumbnail size for socials. He used Photoshop‚Äôs
              noise reduction tool to smooth out the image, and then increased
              the brightness and contrast of the image. This led to the
              following final avatar results shown below.

              was also able to automate the brightness/contrast adjustment with
